# Task 1.7: Toggle Between Map and List View

## Success Criteria

- [ ] A toggle button/control labeled "Map / List" is added to the main interface, positioned at the bottom center.
- [ ] A new List View component is created to display notes.
- [ ] Logic is implemented to switch between the Map View and the List View based on the toggle state.
- [ ] A fade animation is applied during the transition between the Map View and List View.
- [ ] Notes displayed in the List View are styled to resemble sticky notes, consistent with map marker styling where applicable.
- [ ] Notes in the List View are grouped chronologically based on their `created_at` timestamp (e.g., "Today", "Yesterday", "Older").
- [ ] List items (notes) in the List View are tappable/clickable.
- [ ] Tapping/clicking a note in the List View focuses the map on the note's location or opens a detailed view associated with that note.
- [ ] The existing note creation functionality remains accessible and fully functional regardless of whether the Map View or List View is currently active.
