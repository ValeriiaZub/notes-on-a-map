# Notes on a Map üìçüìù

A mobile-first web application that allows users to create location-based notes and visualize them on a map.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Maps**: Leaflet
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup and Authentication (Foundation)
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Set up Supabase project and configure environment variables
- [ ] Implement user authentication (sign up, login, logout)
- [ ] Create database schema for users and notes
- [ ] Set up protected routes and authentication context

### 2. Note Creation Interface (Core Feature)
- [ ] Create mobile-friendly note input component
- [ ] Implement geolocation functionality using browser's Geolocation API
- [ ] Design note creation form with:
  - Text input for note content
  - Automatic location capture
  - Optional location adjustment
- [ ] Add error handling for location services
- [ ] Implement note saving to Supabase

### 3. Map Integration (Visualization)
- [ ] Set up leaflet integration
- [ ] Create responsive map component
- [ ] Implement current location centering
- [ ] Add map markers for saved notes
- [ ] Style map markers and implement clustering for multiple notes

### 4. Note Interaction (User Experience)
- [ ] Create note marker popup component
- [ ] Implement note viewing functionality
- [ ] Add note editing and deletion features
- [ ] Enable drag-and-drop marker repositioning
- [ ]  Update markers style with sticky note-style
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions for marker-to-popup
- [ ] Add real-time position updates during drag
- [ ] Save new marker positions to database

### 5. Data Management (Backend)
- [ ] Set up Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates
- [ ] Add data synchronization
- [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add error boundaries and loading states

### 6. Polish and Optimization
- [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add progressive web app (PWA) support
- [ ] Optimize performance and lazy loading

### 7. Toggle Between Map and List View
- [x] Add a toggle button labeled ‚ÄúMap / List‚Äù at the bottom center
- [ ] Animate transition between views (fade)
- [ ] Match sticky note style in list view
- [ ] Group list notes by time note was created, this informaiton is in database (e.g., ‚ÄúJust now‚Äù, ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äù)
- [ ] Allow notes to be tapped from list to open in full/map view
- [ ] Ensure new note creation is available in both views


### 8. Editable Sticky Notes on Map [x]
- [x] Replace Leaflet Marker popups with custom DOM elements (e.g., using Leaflet‚Äôs DivIcon or L.Layer with custom HTML/CSS to appear as sticky note UI). *(Implemented using custom layer component `InteractiveStickyMarker` with `createPortal`)*
- [x] Implement sticky note visual styles using CSS transforms, fonts, colors, and box shadows (like post-its). Support different colors for notes (e.g., pink, blue, yellow) *(Basic styling implemented in `EditableStickyNoteIcon`, including font)*
- [x] Use Permanent marker google font for the notes, center align text, always fit the context into the avaliable area *(Font loaded and applied)*
- [ ] Apply mav view sticky styling to list view notes
- [x] Add onClick interaction to enter ‚Äúedit mode‚Äù directly on the sticky note (contenteditable div or modal). *(Implemented via click handler and state in `EditableStickyNoteIcon`)*
- [x] Update backend or local state when the sticky note is edited inline. *(Implemented via Supabase update in `EditableStickyNoteIcon`)*
- [ ] Animate sticky note "pop" or ‚Äúbounce‚Äù on drop using CSS animation or Framer Motion (or a similar animation library compatible with codebase). *(Animation not implemented)*
- [x]  Ensure notes move or reposition smoothly as the user pans/zooms the map ‚Äî sticky notes should feel "pinned" to locations. Use useRef + useEffect to control DOM animations when a note is rendered on map. *(Implemented via map event listeners in `InteractiveStickyMarker`)*
- [ ]  Use a shared layout transition for sticky notes moving from the map to list view and vice versa (can use Framer Motion or CSS transitions). *(Transition not implemented)*

**Summary:** Notes are now displayed as interactive sticky notes directly on the map. Clicking a note allows for in-place editing, with changes saved back to the database. Basic styling and the "Permanent Marker" font are applied.

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table (handled by Supabase Auth)
-- Notes table
create table notes (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  content text not null,
  latitude double precision not null,
  longitude double precision not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Enable RLS (Row Level Security)
alter table notes enable row level security;

-- Create policies
create policy "Users can read their own notes" on notes
  for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can create their own notes" on notes
  for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can update their own notes" on notes
  for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can delete their own notes" on notes
  for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
